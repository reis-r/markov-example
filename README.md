# markov-example
A very simple pseudo-random text generator using Markov Chains.
This script will generate random text from a sample text (here called the file "books.txt"). It will use something like Markov Chains. This was meant as a simple reference as how to get started with markov chat bots for fun. :)

[You can see an working example with this Telegram chatbot (click here)](https://telegram.me/delirious_woolf_bot)
